README
==========

This file provides 4 projects, all are implemented in C: 

1. Cache Lab. 
   It consists of 2 parts. (1) hardware cache memory behavior simulating. （2）optimizing a small matrix transpose function with minimizing the number of cache misses.

2. A general dynamic storage allocator
   Implemented my own structure and malloc, free, and realloc functions of an allocator. Used segregated list (several double linked list) with my revised first fit strategy to reduce fragmentation for improving efficiency.

3. Caching Web Proxy
   3.1 Implemented an Http proxy with socket operations as well as multi-threads to handle multiple requests.
   3.2 Added caching feature to the proxy to improve the efficiency of web access.

4. Unix Shell Design
   Implemented a simple Unix shell to interpret command-line, which supports job and process control in background and foreground, signal handing and I/O redirection.

Detailed implementation can be viewed in the inside README.
